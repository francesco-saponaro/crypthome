DEPLOYMENT SECTION AS TO INSTRUCT A THIRD PARTY



# Recipe Cookbook
# UX
## Project Goals
The purpose of this website is to allow users to share and search for recipes from any cultural background, for any taste, dietary requirements, budget, schedule or occasion.  
The user will be able to show support, and give input on another user's recipe through the "like" and "comment" features.  
The website is meant to widen the users's perception, both culturally and culinarily, through the open source and social nature of the website.
### Note for the assessor
Although a profile is not needed to browse for recipes or see the statistics, most of this website features like, adding a recipe,editing or deleting it, liking and commenting a recipe, deleting your own comments and go through your own profile page which includes your own and your favourite recipes, are available once registered and logged in.  
If you would like to test run the website and have fun with the features without having to create an account, you can use this account which has plenty of recipes and history on its name:  
**USERNAME: marie, PASSWORD: marie**.  
Enjoy :)

## Design Choices
The website is fully responsive.  
Due to the large variety of users and their age group, the overall feel of the website is designed to be clear and neat to allow for a smooth and flowing experience, regardless of who the user is. With this in mind the Materialize framework was used and this design choices were made:
### Fonts
* The standard materialize fonts were kept.
### Icons
* All Icons were taken from Font awesome and were chosen based on their clearness and message conveying ability. The like icon is in the form of a heart, once clicked it will turn red to further convey the sense of community.
### Colours
* The primary colors are a combination of dark red/bordeaux and dark green, and white and light grey, making it softer on the eye.
### Styling 
* Panels, forms and containers were given a white color with a thin bordeaux border on a light grey body, making it gentle and easy to navigate. On hovering and focus, most times colour combinations are inverted and with a smooth transition.
### Images
* The recipe images were chosen based on their definition and ability to portray the dish. However, users are able to chose whichever image suit their taste. If an image is not uploaded, a placeholder image is loaded instead, informing users that no image is available.

### Client stories testing
The website flow is designed so that every page available to the user is accessible through the Navbar or slider menu, which interchange depending on screen size. The "Register" and "Log in" links interchange with the "Profile" and "Log out" links depending on if the user is logged in or not.  
Defensive programming was implemented to:
* Make sure logged in or logged out users are not able to access other user`s accounts and pages by pasting their URL. On trying to do so they will be redirected to the Home page.
* Make sure users dont log in without authentication by pasting the right URL. On trying to do so they will be redirected to the Home page.
* In the case of a 404 or 500 error the user will be redirected to a page informing him of the error and with a link to go back to the Home page.

### Browsers
* Mozilla, Chrome, Edge and Safari all display same projected layout and have no issues at any screen sizes.

* The website is fully responsive through the Materialize grid system and media queries, starting from a screen size as small as 280px to as large as 1680px.
* All features are available and visible on every screen size. The Navbar becomes a toggled side menu on small screen sizes.
### Bugs discovered
* Upon deploying and testing the application on Iphone, I found that none of the single or multiple options Materialize select elements were responding correctly. When trying to select an element the wrong elements would be selected, this happened every single time. Therefore I decided to replace all single option select elements with the respective "browser default" version, and all multiple option select elements with the Select2 version.  
All elements now work as desired.
* I tried to sort recipes by User likes descending, however, I found that after liking a recipe, pagination would render the wrong recipes, removing some from the page and duplicating others. I tried to find out why with the assistance of a tutor but unfortunately we couldn't fix it. Therefore I decided to display recipes in no particular order which fixed the issue.
* When displaying filtered results, the "recipe name" filter info will display with a colon punctuation ":" prior to the name. I have managed to remove all other unnecessary syntax from the results with the "replace" method, however, I don't seem to be able to target this particular colon.
* When adding a comment, the comment does not immediately show in the comments section below. It will only show once leaving the page and reloading it.
* Fixed Firefox Unordered list aligning issue by adding -moz-fit-content to the width property and -moz-center to the text-align property.
* A few days prior to submitting this projects, upon trying to open the deployed version of the website, the page would throw a "Type Error - None object is not subscriptable". This would only happen if I tried to log in from my laptop, while it worked fine on my phone. I fixed this error by clearing the data on the application storage on the dev tools. Unfortunately, even with the help of a tutor, I wasn't able to find out why this happened.

## Deployment 
This project was developed using Gitpod, a [Github repository](https://github.com/francesc-droid/recipe-cookbook) was created and regular commits were pushed to the repository through Git commands.

The project was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using the following steps:
* Set environment variables and made sure they were in the gitignore file and not being tracked.
* Created requirements.txt for dependencies and Procfile to tell which file is required to run the app: pip3 freeze --local requirements.txt echo web: python app.py > Procfile. I made sure you remove the blank line from the Procfile as it might cause problems when running the app on Heroku.
* Created new Heroku app from the Heroku website by clicking "Create new app".
* Connected my app from my Github repository by clicking on the Github icon in my app's "Deploy" section, then clicked "Search" and once it found my repo I clicked "connect".
* Before I clicked "Enable automatic deployment" I needed to tell Heroku which hidden environment variables were required (the ones hidden in the env.py file), so I clicked on the "Settings" tab and then on "Reveal config vars" and added all required hidden variables.
* Went back to "Deploy" tab, clicked on "Enable automatic deployment" and then directly below it clicked on "Deploy branch"
Heroku will now receive the code from Github and start building the app using the required packages.
* After a minute or so the message "Your app was successfully deployed" appeared, I then clicked on the "View" button below that message to launch my app.
* The deployed site was now available and automatically updated whenever I pushed changes to the Github repository.
* My deployed website can be found [here](https://recipe-cookbook-fran.herokuapp.com/).
